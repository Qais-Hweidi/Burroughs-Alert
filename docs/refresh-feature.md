# ✅ Refresh Button with Live Scraping

## What's New

When you click the **"Refresh"** button on the listings page (`/listings?alertId=X`), it now:

1. **🔄 Shows "Scraping Craigslist for fresh listings..."** with spinning icon
2. **🕷️ Triggers live Craigslist scraping** (15-minute quick run)
3. **📊 Loads fresh data** from the database after scraping
4. **✨ Updates the UI** with any new apartments found

## How It Works

### Before (Old Behavior):

- Refresh → Load existing data from database
- No new listings unless background jobs were running

### After (New Behavior):

- Refresh → Trigger scraper → Wait 2 seconds → Load fresh data
- Always gets the latest apartments from Craigslist

## User Experience

1. **Click "Refresh" button** on listings page
2. **See "Scraping Craigslist..."** message appear
3. **Wait ~15-30 seconds** for scraping to complete
4. **Get fresh listings** that match your alert criteria

## Technical Implementation

- **Modified**: `src/app/listings/page.tsx` - Added scraper trigger to refresh
- **Modified**: `src/app/api/jobs/route.ts` - Allow standalone job execution
- **Modified**: `src/components/listings/ListingsGrid.tsx` - Updated loading message

### API Call Flow:

```
1. User clicks "Refresh"
2. Frontend calls POST /api/jobs {"action": "trigger", "jobType": "scraper"}
3. API runs scraper directly (even without job system)
4. Frontend waits 2 seconds
5. Frontend calls GET /api/listings with alert criteria
6. Fresh listings displayed
```

## Benefits

- **✅ Immediate fresh data** without waiting for scheduled jobs
- **✅ Works without background job system** running
- **✅ User-controlled scraping** when they want latest listings
- **✅ Better user experience** with clear loading states

## Testing

You can test this by:

1. Going to any listings page (e.g., `/listings?alertId=6`)
2. Clicking the "Refresh" button
3. Watching it scrape and display fresh results

The scraper will find the latest apartments posted on Craigslist in the last few hours that match your search criteria.
