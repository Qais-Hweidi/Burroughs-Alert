/**
 * Craigslist Apartment Scraper
 * 
 * Scrapes apartment listings from Craigslist NYC across all 5 boroughs.
 * Uses Puppeteer for robust scraping with anti-detection measures.
 * 
 * Features to implement:
 * - Multi-borough scraping (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island)
 * - Anti-detection measures (user agent rotation, delays, headless mode)
 * - Data extraction and normalization
 * - Error handling and retry logic
 * - Rate limiting and respectful scraping
 * 
 * Scraping Strategy:
 * - Target URL: https://newyork.craigslist.org/search/apa
 * - Borough-specific searches for comprehensive coverage
 * - Random delays between requests (2-5 seconds)
 * - User agent rotation for anonymity
 * - Headless browser for efficiency
 * - Retry mechanism for failed requests
 * 
 * Data Extraction:
 * - Title and description parsing
 * - Price extraction and validation
 * - Neighborhood identification and normalization
 * - Bedroom/bathroom count extraction
 * - Pet policy detection
 * - Contact information extraction
 * - Image URL collection
 * - Posting date and ID
 * 
 * Anti-Detection Measures:
 * - Random user agents from real browsers
 * - Randomized request intervals
 * - IP rotation (if needed)
 * - Viewport randomization
 * - JavaScript execution delays
 * - Cookie and session management
 * 
 * Error Handling:
 * - Network timeout handling
 * - Captcha detection and alerting
 * - Rate limit detection
 * - Data validation and cleaning
 * - Graceful degradation on failures
 *

 * - docs/08-scraping-strategy.md (detailed scraping approach)
