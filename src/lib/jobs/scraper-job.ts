/**
 * Background Scraper Job System
 *
 * Manages automated apartment listing scraping with intelligent scheduling.
 * Implements randomized intervals and job queue management for reliable data collection.
 *
 * Features to implement:
 * - Randomized job scheduling (30-45 minute intervals)
 * - Job queue management and processing
 * - Error handling and retry logic
 * - Performance monitoring and metrics
 * - Graceful shutdown and cleanup
 *
 * Job Scheduling Strategy:
 * - Base interval: 30 minutes
 * - Random variance: Â±15 minutes
 * - Adaptive scheduling based on success rates
 * - Time-of-day considerations (lower activity during peak hours)
 * - Failure backoff and retry logic
 *
 * Processing Pipeline:
 * 1. Execute scraping pipeline (scraper + scam detection)
 * 2. Process and store new listings
 * 3. Run alert matching for new listings
 * 4. Send notifications for matches
 * 5. Update job metrics and logs
 * 6. Schedule next job execution
 *
 * Error Handling:
 * - Exponential backoff for repeated failures
 * - Circuit breaker for persistent issues
 * - Partial failure recovery
 * - Dead letter queue for failed jobs
 * - Alert system administrators on critical failures
 *
 * Job State Management:
 * - Job status tracking (pending, running, completed, failed)
 * - Progress monitoring and reporting
 * - Resource usage tracking
 * - Concurrent job prevention
 * - Job history and audit trail
 *
 * Performance Optimization:
 * - Resource usage monitoring
 * - Memory leak prevention
 * - Database connection management
 * - Efficient data processing
 * - Cleanup of temporary resources
 *
 * Configuration:
 * - Interval configuration via environment variables
 * - Job timeout settings
 * - Retry attempt limits
 * - Resource usage limits
 * - Logging level configuration
 *

 * - docs/03-architecture.md (background job architecture)
 * - docs/07-algorithms-pseudocode.md (job scheduling algorithms)
