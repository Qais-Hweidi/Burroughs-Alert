/**
 * Database Cleanup Job System
 *
 * Manages data retention and cleanup policies for privacy compliance and performance.
 * Implements automated cleanup of old listings, notifications, and expired tokens.
 *
 * Features to implement:
 * - Automated data retention enforcement
 * - Expired listing cleanup
 * - Old notification history removal
 * - Unsubscribe token expiration
 * - Database optimization and maintenance
 *
 * Cleanup Policies:
 * - Listings: Remove after 30 days (configurable)
 * - Notifications: Keep history for 90 days
 * - Unsubscribe tokens: Expire after 30 days
 * - Inactive alerts: Mark for review after 6 months
 * - Error logs: Rotate after 30 days
 * - Temporary files: Clean up daily
 *
 * Privacy Compliance:
 * - Automatic data deletion for privacy
 * - User data minimization
 * - Secure deletion of sensitive information
 * - Audit trail for compliance reporting
 * - GDPR-style data retention policies
 *
 * Database Maintenance:
 * - VACUUM operations for SQLite optimization
 * - Index maintenance and rebuilding
 * - Statistics updates for query optimization
 * - Orphaned record cleanup
 * - Foreign key constraint validation
 *
 * Performance Optimization:
 * - Batch deletion for efficiency
 * - Transaction management for consistency
 * - Progress tracking for large operations
 * - Resource usage monitoring
 * - Minimal impact scheduling (off-peak hours)
 *
 * Scheduling Strategy:
 * - Daily cleanup at low-traffic hours (3 AM EST)
 * - Weekly deep cleaning operations
 * - Monthly database optimization
 * - Quarterly compliance audits
 * - Emergency cleanup triggers
 *
 * Monitoring and Reporting:
 * - Cleanup operation metrics
 * - Data volume tracking
 * - Performance impact measurement
 * - Error rate monitoring
 * - Compliance reporting
 *
 * Safety Measures:
 * - Backup verification before major cleanups
 * - Rollback capabilities for critical errors
 * - Data validation before deletion
 * - Administrative alerts for unusual patterns
 * - Manual override capabilities
