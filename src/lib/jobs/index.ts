/**
 * Background Job System Entry Point
 * 
 * Orchestrates all background jobs for the apartment alert system.
 * Provides centralized job management, scheduling, and monitoring.
 * 
 * Features to implement:
 * - Job scheduler initialization and management
 * - Job queue coordination
 * - System health monitoring
 * - Error handling and recovery
 * - Graceful shutdown procedures
 * 
 * Job Types:
 * - Scraper Job: Automated listing collection (30-45 min intervals)
 * - Matcher Job: Alert-to-listing matching and notifications (triggered by scraper)
 * - Cleanup Job: Data retention and database optimization (daily)
 * - Health Check: System status monitoring (every 5 minutes)
 * 
 * Job Coordination:
 * - Sequential job execution to prevent conflicts
 * - Resource sharing and management
 * - Job dependencies and triggers
 * - Priority-based execution
 * - Load balancing and throttling
 * 
 * Scheduling Management:
 * - Cron-like scheduling for regular jobs
 * - Event-driven job triggering
 * - Dynamic interval adjustment
 * - Time zone handling (EST for NYC focus)
 * - Holiday and maintenance window awareness
 * 
 * Error Handling:
 * - Job failure detection and alerting
 * - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
 * - Circuit breaker for persistent failures
 * - Dead letter queue management
 * - Emergency job termination
 * 
 * Monitoring and Metrics:
 * - Job execution tracking
 * - Performance metrics collection
 * - Resource usage monitoring
 * - Success/failure rate tracking
 * - System health dashboards
 * 
 * Development vs Production:
 * - Local development job simulation
 * - Test environment job isolation
 * - Production monitoring and alerting
 * - Environment-specific configuration
 * - Debug mode and logging levels
 * 
 * Graceful Shutdown:
 * - Job completion before shutdown
 * - Resource cleanup procedures
 * - State persistence for recovery
 * - Signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
 * - Cleanup timeout management
 * 
 * Configuration:
 * - Environment variable management
 * - Job interval configuration
 * - Resource limit settings
 * - Logging and monitoring setup
 * - Feature flag integration
 *

 * - docs/03-architecture.md (background job architecture)
